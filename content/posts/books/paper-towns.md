## 

### Summary
Slow at times, but engaging until the end - I thoroughly enjoyed [Paper Towns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6442769-paper-towns) by John Green (JG).

We view the story through the lens of Q, Margo's childhood friend. Q views Margo with a certain impression - as untouchable and idolises her.

My favourite passage
