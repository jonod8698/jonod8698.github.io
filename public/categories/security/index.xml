    <description><![CDATA[What is WPAD? WPAD stands for Windows Proxy Auto-Discovery. It is a protocol to obtain the URL for a PAC file.
WPAD uses the following methods in order to discover the PAC file URL:
 DHCP DNS WINS LLMNR NetBIOS Hosts Lmhosts  The PAC file tells the host where to direct network traffic. This is usually used to force traffic through a web proxy.
Why is it insecure? When DHCP or DNS is misconfigured or not configured, an attacker can provide the client with a PAC file that directs traffic to a compromised server.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Summary RCG protects admin credentials by ensuring they are not passed over the network to the target device.
Details Clients with RCG enabled do not send primary credentials to the target machine. This mitigates the risk of stolen credentials if the target is compromised.
In RCG, the client LSA acts as a reverse proxy for ticket requests from the target. Hence, the target never needs to store primary credentials.
RCG will not allow NTLM fallback.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Problem Statement Accounts with bad passwords, especially accounts with privileged access are the Achilles heel of an organisation’s security. Traditionally IT has tried to impose “strong password policies” such as “Choose a password with an uppercase letter, a number, a symbol and more than 10 characters”. However, a password like “Summer2020!” satisfies ALL those requirements despite being an immesurably weak password.
So, what can we as IT professionals do to reduce bad passwords and mitigate their impact?]]></description>
