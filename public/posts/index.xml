    <description><![CDATA[Summary RCG protects admin credentials by ensuring they are not passed over the network to the target device.
Details Clients with RCG enabled do not send primary credentials to the target machine. This mitigates the risk of stolen credentials if the target is compromised.
In RCG, the client LSA acts as a reverse proxy for ticket requests from the target. Hence, the target never needs to store primary credentials.
RCG will not allow NTLM fallback.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Problem Statement Accounts with bad passwords, especially accounts with privileged access are the Achilles heel of an organisation’s security. Traditionally IT has tried to impose “strong password policies” such as “Choose a password with an uppercase letter, a number, a symbol and more than 10 characters”. However, a password like “Summer2020!” satisfies ALL those requirements despite being an immesurably weak password.
So, what can we as IT professionals do to reduce bad passwords and mitigate their impact?]]></description>

Hugo Setup Install Hugo I&rsquo;m using the CodeIT Hugo theme. This requires Hugo Extended.
Installation via Chocolatey
choco install hugo-extended Create a new site Hugo will create a new site named &lt;my-site&gt;
hugo new site &lt;my-site&gt; Install a theme I like the simplicity and aesthetics of the CodeIT theme.
